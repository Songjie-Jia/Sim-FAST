Simulator For Active STructures (Sim-FAST)

I am hoping to create an educational code package for active structures, including tensegrity, origami, trusses, mechanisms, metamaterials, and many others. 
This package is still under construction.
Eventually, there will be a note associated with this package that will be published. 
Hoepfully I will get the opportunity of teaching it one day.
