## Simulator For Active STructures (Sim-FAST)

I am hoping to create an educational code package for active structures, 
including tensegrity, origami, trusses, mechanisms, metamaterials, and many others. 
This package is still under construction.
Eventually, there will be a note associated with this package that will be published. 
Hoepfully I will get the opportunity of teaching it one day. 

The following Intro Figure shows a few working examples.

## As of Jan 13th. 

The code is working for a few examples, including active truss, thin origami, thick origami, mechanism, and knitting structures. 

Not particularly sure how much effort I can spend on this as the semester start. 
Will continue working on the code when have time.
