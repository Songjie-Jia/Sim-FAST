The elements in this folder are solved using exact solution. 
Bascially, the internal forces and stiffness is calculated 
using equations from exact analytical solutions (Not solved
using central difference method). These elements can be more
stable numerically. 

Some elements are vectorized in the code, which makes them 
faster to compute. It is recomended to use these elements 
when working on large models, where speed and stability can
be very helpful.
