%% 4-Node Rotational Spring Elements (directional stiffness)
% This rotational spring element is derived using analytical equations
% The rotational spring element is vectorized 
% The formulation is for a bi-linear elastic rotational spring
% This element uses different stiffness for different folding direction
% The rotational spring geometry is defined with 4 nodes

        % MV stiffness (Ns*1)
        % Here we assume that the folding stiffness is directional, the
        % element is more likely to fold in one direction compare to the
        % other direction. This is used to consider contact related
        % behaviors for thick origami hinges

        % Threshold for local penertration prevention
        % The theta1 and theta2 are terms for initiating the penertration 
        % prevention. When folding angle is smaller than theta1 or bigger 
        % than theta 2, an additional forces is added. Please check the 
        % Liu and Paulino RSPA paper for details.
